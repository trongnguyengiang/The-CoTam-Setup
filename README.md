This is the updated version of the quota setup repository. This aims to automate the process of set-up the quota on Excel - a manual task at Analytix Intelligence in Vietnam and other countries that takes quite a lot of time. In this version, users experience a more user-friendly usage, which covers all four common cases that mostly appear in daily work. Why Co Tam? Because I want to breathe a Vietnamese spirit into the tool that is made by the Vietnamese, so that it appeals to members in other countries. In addition, Co Tam Setup rhymes with quota setup.
